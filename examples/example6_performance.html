    <h1>Example 6 - Performance Tool</h1>
    <p>
        The Performance tool gives you insight into your site's general responsiveness, JavaScript and layout performance. With the Performance tool you create a recording, or profile, of your site over a period of time. The tool then shows you an overview of the things the browser was doing to render your site over the profile, and a graph of the frame rate over the profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few different ways to open the Performanace tool:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>press Shift + F5</li>
      <li>select "Performance" from the Web Developer submenu in the Firefox Menu (or Tools menu if you display the menu bar or are on OS X)</li>
      <li>select "Performance" from Tools button, in the Toolbar, if you have one</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
